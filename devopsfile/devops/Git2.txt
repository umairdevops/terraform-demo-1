1)Git tag
 A tag is like a branch that doesn't change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.
Tags are usually used to mark stable releases
git tag
[]git tag
[]git tag  <tagname>
[]git push origin <tagname>
------------------
2)Git cherrypic
The command git cherry-pick is typically used to introduce particular commits from one branch within a repository onto a different branch.
Git allows you to integrate selected, individual commits from any branch into your current HEAD branch.
The HEAD points out the last commit in the current checkout branch. It is like a pointer to any reference. The HEAD can be understood as the "current branch." When you switch branches with 'checkout,' the HEAD is transferred to the new branch.
[]git cherry-pick commitid
-------------------------------
3)Git rebase
The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history.

4)Git fork

5)git amend
